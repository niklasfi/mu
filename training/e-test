but it is of doubtful benefit to German workers who also would have liked to cooperate with that capital . 
the fifth shock was German unification , which is a failure in economic terms . 
all five shocks constitute historical developments that are good for the world as a whole , but problematic for Germany . 
in order for the country to meet the challenges and to continue to grow , it would have to make its labor markets flexible . 
only then will we know whether Germany can meet the Toynbeean challenge it is facing . 
it demonstrated the power of globalization , as television brought vivid pictures of the destruction to homes around the world . 
indeed , it is at times like this that the world truly does seem like a global village . 
America 's aid still appeared niggardly when compared with the amounts offered by countries with a fraction of America 's economic wealth . 
they did ask one thing : a reduction of tariff barriers and greater access to markets abroad . 
no one pretends that we can prevent or alter the forces of nature . 
rather , we have to learn to cope with them . 
there are now calls for improved tsunami early warning systems . 
but in one area , global warming , we have already received an early warning . 
we are , however , still not a global village . 
optimists say that technology will solve the problem . 
boom and doom pundits are the most reliable over-claimers . 
indeed , the media shower lavish attention on over-claimers while neglecting their humbler colleagues . 
they know how to stoke momentum in an argument by multiplying reasons why they are right and others are wrong . 
that wins them media acclaim . 
they take their theories too seriously . 
but that is unfair . 
no society has yet created a widely trusted method for keeping score on the punditocracy . 
what Next for Europe ? 
one of the few good ideas contained in the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services . 
because services account for 70 % of European GDP , the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial . 
but removing protection is always politically difficult . 
not surprisingly , the proposal was quickly shelved . 
many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground , no matter what . 
Europe has agreed to a single trade policy . 
there is little reason for optimism . 
the sharpness of political attacks on the ECB might trigger dangerous talk about restricting its independence . 
the current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment . 
the same is true across the Atlantic . 
the US Federal Reserve Board is , of course , very independent . 
yet monetary policy is not a unique species of economic policymaking . 
aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians in line . 
so why do we see this large difference in reality in both America and Europe ? 
it is not necessary to please 100 % of the voters , only enough to win . 
the fiscal card is critical in choosing which groups of voters to buy . 
this is far more difficult ! 
of course , monetary policy also has redistributive effects . 
think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors . 
these considerations should guide the choice of what will follow the Stability Pact in Europe . 
politicians are willing to go to great lengths to please their supporters and win elections . 
the best that we can plausibly hope for is to ensure that the worst of what they do is done out in the open . 
it would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges . 
however , they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable . 
negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015 . 
with 80 million people , Turkey would be one of the largest EU states . 
because of its weak economy , Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance . 
immigration should not be a cause for undue concern , either . 
among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable , Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation . 
it is Turkey 's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions . 
many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture . 
but the same is true for any other democracy , where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes . 
Turkey 's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer , one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world . 
Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges . 
on balance , however , the advantages far outweigh the risks . 
playing at Democracy 
increasingly , free expression of opinion does not influence or restrain how government behaves . 
consider the United States . 
never before was there so much opposition to a war 
the current war in Iraq is perhaps the strongest proof of this . 
failure is punished by unrest , disaffection , and stagnation . on April 18 
today 's Asian policymakers confront a very different environment from that faced by their predecessors fifty years ago . 
Asia 's population has more than doubled since 1950 , with most of that growth coming in its poorest countries . 
the political systems of these countries were tailored to small , static , rural populations . 
now these societies must cope not only with vast urban centers , but also with the very different talents and demands of urbanized people . 
the global economy has changed dramatically , too . 
for example , international bodies such as the WTO have changed the framework within which economic decisions are taken . 
local economic change has been equally dramatic . 
foreign investment from within and outside the region has altered the structure of domestic economies . 
so new rules of the game are needed . 
in most Asian countries , formal rules need to be simplified and applied more fairly . 
few countries score strongly here . 
in parts of South Asia , violent conflict and the power of vested interests threaten the rule of law . 
most business is not conducted in courts but in meetings where trust and reputation are essential . 
but governments retain a role in fostering an enabling environment within which markets operate . 
trade is potentially a positive-sum game , with all countries benefiting by exploiting their areas of comparative advantage . 
international comparison of systems therefore plays an important role . 
the private sector and civil society are , of course , increasingly important partners for governments . 
so should every country adopt a recall procedure to maintain the legitimacy of governments ? 
absolutely not . 
but leaders must be given the chance to govern . 
but sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere . 
so the case for representative government remains strong . 
parliaments talk before reaching conclusions ; hence their name . 
leadership needs time to take and implement unpopular decisions as well as popular ones . 
leaders themselves need the nerve to take often precarious parliamentary majorities through the troughs of popularity . 
the uneasy partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is a good example of this tactic . 
leaders who never risk their popularity are not worth their position . 
Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact 
the reduction in tax collection can increase disposable income . 
the fall in taxes and the rise in spending do widen the budget deficit , but in a healthy and useful way . 
on the American side of the Atlantic , the usefulness of these automatic fiscal stabilizers is unchallenged . 
on the contrary , whenever recession threatens , political debate revolves around whether they need to be reinforced by 
nor is it even a fiscal discipline issue . 
we know the origins of the Stability and Growth Pact . 
but it is dangerous to become obsessed with the past . 
but if this is an issue solved over fifty years ago , why is it haunting us now ? 
justifying Humanitarian Intervention 
each spoke easily about institutions , democratic procedures , and respect for the rule of law . 
but human rights were another matter entirely . 
in each country , I presented lists of political prisoners and asked about their fates . 
the international system rather quickly adopted ( and transformed ) this notion , and numerous humanitarian 
promoting respect for human rights was , after all , the guiding principle behind the UN 's establishment . 
moreover , the principle of sovereignty itself needs redefinition . 
legal restraints on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators too often use it to justify criminal aggression . 
in this wider and uncertain context , the need to regulate humanitarian military intervention looms large . 
what Does America Want ? 
I speak not of principles , but of policy . 
the US does not have a " one size fits all " approach to the world . 
but defense policy is only one component of foreign policy . 
not every threat to America 's national interests can be addressed with military power . 
partnership is essential here . 
such institutions can and often do advance US national interests . 
the World Trade Organization is a case in point . 
but the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities . 
multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values . 
the UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals . 
this flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon . 
one of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states . 
of course , there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence . 
but inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability , threatening security . 
nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty . 
to be sure , the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades . 
overall , however , the inequality gaps are large and , in many cases , growing . 
such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally . 
meanwhile , free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends . 
countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off . 
the Fed was late in beginning the interest-rate normalization process , and it is now paying a price . 
money-supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now , indicating excess liquidity . 
in these circumstances , there is no good reason to wait to raise interest rates . 
no one wants this . 
the exit process has begun . 
but it 's easy for politicians to be irresponsible about monetary policy . 
this is not the type of volatile monetary policy that Europe wants or needs . 
the West Versus the Rest ? 
the Madrid bombings have made Europeans feel the scourge of terrorism in their bones . 
March 11 is now Europe 's version of September 11 in America . 
does this mean that Europe and the US have dramatically different visions ? 
part of the seeming disconnect on foreign policy emerges from a misunderstanding about what " Europe " is about . 
the European project is a realist 's response to globalization and its challenges . 
having achieved these goals , Europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments . 
indeed , France and Germany do not get along naturally . 
most Americans still see in Europe a partner with largely the same aims in the world . 
most Europeans see in America a strong friend . 
the creation of such a capacity will make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner . 
the only way to arrest such fears is through closer and more frequent dialogue . 
some in the West have tried to conjure a " Clash of Civilizations " out of our troubled times . 
our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against anybody in particular . 
the government is still lagging on its domestic economic reforms . 
but failure to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term . 
hence it would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately . 
exporters could exchange 30 % of their earnings at the market rate . 
it does not seem to matter that such troops are being used to enforce the UN 's own demands . 
but is this right ? 
history suggests not . 
the UN arose from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations was unable to avert . 
it took a coalition of the willing to save Bosnia from extinction . 
when the war was over , peace was made in Dayton , Ohio , not at the UN . 
this century now challenges the hopes for a new world order in new ways . 
Iraq was such a state , but there are others . 
so we are left with coalitions of the willing . 
it is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus . 
the key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy . 
encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work . 
for this , governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick . 
learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development . 
building and solidifying these institutions , however , takes time . 
a key point here is that institutional arrangements are , by necessity , country-specific . 
discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation . 
reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others . 
adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it . 
in both cases , it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other . 
critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse . 
the Other Central Europe 
Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he , too , could play a demagogic nationalist card . 
to defuse an electoral fight with his rival , Schroeder agreed . 
questions about postwar Europe 's juridical order go beyond the former Czechoslovakia . 
in the 1930s , the pet hate of some Central European countries was " the Versailles Order . " 
what can halt this ? 
notions about " collective guilt " were put aside as having no place in a united and uniting Europe . 
the Iraq war 's main consequences will not be on the battlefield . 
if they are vindicated , then the war could conceivably bring a safer world . 
the Iraq War was not and could not be justified on the basis that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant . 
Bush and Blair made four claims : 
Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction ; 
those weapons pose a grave , immediate threat ; 
UN inspections were not eliminating that threat ; 
the threat could best be eliminated by war . 
the first claim should be the easiest to verify . 
the second claim will be trickier to prove . 
we know that Iraq at one time possessed chemical and biological weapons , because the US sold them to Iraq . 
if the Iraqis launch an attack with such weapons , this would demonstrate that the weapons were ready for use . 
the third claim is hugely contentious . 
Bush and Blair should demonstrate that the UN inspection process was failing . 
the fourth claim will be subject to wild propaganda on both sides . 
this would change if evidence on the four points is mustered . 
such an explanation , backed by rigorous evidence , is no less necessary today . 
if the arguments for war are not proved , the consequences will be profound . 
still , the war would then at least make some sense . 
the horrors of a senseless war are almost too frightening to contemplate . 
remembering and Forgetting Zhao Ziyang 
so , at last former Chinese Premier and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has died . 
whether Zhao 's supporters will express themselves in a similar fashion is uncertain . 
the Real Risks of Deficits 
America 's government budget deficit now stands at $ 455 billion , 4.1 % of GDP . 
two years ago , the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see . 
by running a deficit , a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations . 
politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations . 
their priority is paying for immediate problems , and for today 's promised benefits . 
but what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not . 
no generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation . 
but such arguments , although valid at times , have their limits . 
governments could decide to act this way again , especially if national debts grow bigger . 
continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed . 
what it does mean is that the problem is political . 
what we need is the right system from the beginning , so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations . 
take global warming . 
time and again , he questions the scientific evidence . 
so no change in policy . 
whatever the case , American policy was not based on evidence . 
since the Cold War 's end , America is the world 's sole superpower . 
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this ; but they don 't vote in American elections . 
even so , the rest of the world is not powerless . 
economic globalization has , however , outpaced political globalization ; the processes for decision making are far from democratic , or even transparent . 
in that case , Europe was as much the culprit as America . 
the True Costs of the Iraq War 
the most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless . 
nor does the administration want to face up to the military 's recruiting and retention problems . 
of course , the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families . 
but the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings . 
but the costs don 't stop there . 
at the same time , money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere . 
there are a number of other costs , some potentially quite large , although quantifying them is problematic . 
that Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs . 
in short , even our " moderate " estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America 's involvement in Iraq . 
and our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself . 
nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war . 
but such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration 's reckoning . 
do democracies need values ? 
what is the Western model of democratic development really worth ? 
beyond fundamental freedoms and economic prosperity , do we have a specific civilization to defend ? 
this is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist regimes , because , to foster free societies , they must be deposed . 
can we oppose them with anything but individual rights ? 
first , we must update our social contract . 
in many countries , however , political parties find it difficult even to contemplate such debates . 
the fight for democracy cannot be selective . 
a desirable vision for the future of humanity must appeal to universally shared conceptions of justice and equity . 
we must all become freedom fighters . 
elections Are Venezuela 's Last Chance 
Venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate . 
the Chávez government has not helped Venezuela 's poor in any significant way . 
now Chávez lacks majority backing even among the poor . 
the opposition 's view--shared by rightists in the Bush administration--is equally unconvincing . 
after all , confrontations like this are not unusual in Latin America 's rigid presidential systems . 
to be acceptable to both sides , such a solution must deviate from the favorite proposals of each . 
both proposals are thus politically unfeasible . 
that mechanism is an election , to be held as soon as possible ( realistically , by this summer ) . 
both sides will have to work hard if they want to win . 
President Chávez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his " Bolivarian Revolution . " 
at home , Assad 's regime also finds itself in a bind . 
political and economic reform , when it advances , does so at a glacial pace . 
Assad is now in a consolidation phase , leaving little room for reform . 
the reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad 's preferences . 
consolidation , however , is not reform . 
Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation . 
until now , the president has toed a hard line on Iraq , on Lebanon , and in domestic affairs .
